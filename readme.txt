Driver-Alertness-Detection" employs the Haar Cascade algorithm, utilizing shape predictors. This project detects signs of drowsiness in drivers by analyzing facial features such as eyes and mouth. Haar Cascades identify features, and shape predictors refine accuracy, enhancing real-time monitoring for potential fatigue-related hazards.
